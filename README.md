### Hello! 


My name is Maddie Ore (she/her) and I'm a PhD candidate at Cornell University. 

My dissertation research is on finding the environmental drivers of genomic change in the Black-throated Blue Warbler 🐦. I am using genomics tools to look for the genomic underpinnings of local adaptation. I am interested in how species adapt to environmental conditions and if genomic adaptation has the capacity to keep pace with rapidly changing environments. More broadly, I am interested in how we can use genomic tools to better implement conservation. 

I'm new to coding (started coding for my graduate research) and still have a lot to learn 🤓
